# Pok√©Test

Pok√©Test is a memory game inspired by the popular Pok√©mon franchise.

The goal is to test your memory and knowledge of Pok√©mon by selecting different cards from a grid. Each card represents a Pok√©mon, and you can only select each one once. If you select a card that you have already chosen before, you lose the game. If you manage to select all the cards without any duplicates, you win the game.

Pok√©Test is built using React and the Pok√©mon data for the cards is fetched from Pok√©API, a free and open-source RESTful API that provides information about Pok√©mon, their types, abilities, moves, and more.

### Why I made this project

I made this project as a way to practice and learn more about React, especially the useState and useEffect hooks. I wanted to create a simple but engaging game that would showcase the power and flexibility of React. I also wanted to use an external API to fetch data and display it dynamically on the screen. I chose Pok√©API because I am a fan of Pok√©mon and I think it is a great resource for developers and fans alike.

I hope you enjoy playing Pok√©Test and find it useful as a learning tool. If you have any feedback, suggestions, or questions, feel free to contact me at elliotakande@gmail.com. Thank you for your interest and support! üòä
